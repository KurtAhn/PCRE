This project aims to reveal the scoring mechanism of the test on <a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org/test">politicalcompass.org</a>.

Go to "results" folder to access the scoring chart accurate as of November 10th, 2016.

The website seems to get updated every now and then, and in that case, follow the instructions in "PCReversal.java" to reconstruct the scoring chart.
